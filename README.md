Festival Tycoon Tool for adding custom songs using Electron JS and Express JS


Use NODE js to run the server and the client seperatly. 
the client should be sending the correct rquests to the server.

in order to add songs make sure: 
1. the song is in WAV format.
2. the song is located at the "Bands" folder. for me its: Z:\PC\Festival Tycoon\UserFiles\Bands

the app is on very eraly stages with barely any error handling so expect a buggy experience.
